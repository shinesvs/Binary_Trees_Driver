# Binary_Trees_Driver
A C-based implementation of binary tree operations with all traversal algorithms — inorder, preorder, postorder, and level-order — built using modular design with separate queue and tree components. Includes clean header abstractions and a simple driver program (main.c) for testing traversal outputs.
